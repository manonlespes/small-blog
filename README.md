** Playing with REST APIs **

Part of the programm I am following on Scrimba, I had fun on playing a bit with API ðŸŽ‰

This small project covers the following topics:
- URLs & endpoints
- Methods
- Body
- Headers
- Rest APIs Resources
- Rest APIs Parameters
- Rest APIs queries

For a quick start ðŸ’œ:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````
